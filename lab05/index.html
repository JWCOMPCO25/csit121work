            <h2>Lab 02: HTML Basics</h2>
            
            <p class="date"><em>September 14, 2025</em></p>
            
            <p>I'm in the process of learning Hypterext Markup Language (HTML). It's an 
                extensive markup language with established rules and structures. This page 
                offers a reflection of what I've learned so far on this journey. Below you 
                will find a list of some of those things.
            </p>

            <h3>Some HTML knowledge gained so far:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>How to make both ordered and unordered lists.</li>
                <li>How to <em>italicize</em> and <strong>bold</strong> text.</li>
                <li>Adding <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">hyperlinks</a> to a page.</li>
                <li>Knowing the difference between block and inline elements.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Knowledge is power!</h3>
            <p>I'm currently enrolled in a web standards course to get a more in-depth understanding of the internet 
                and the World Wide Web. Through this course I've been introduced to helpful resources on the
                topic of HTML, two of which are:</p>
                <ul id="list">
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3cschools</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">Mozilla Developer Network</a></li>
                </ul>
            <p>There is still much more to learn about hypertext markup language. It will be a lengthy journey
                but I'm confident my knowledge and understanding will only increase with practice and time.</p>

            <h3>Lab 03: Enter the CSS</h3>
            <p class="date"><em>September 21, 2025</em></p>
            <p>This week was a dive into CSS or <u>Cascading Style Sheets.</u>
            It's a powerful language with so many options to choose from.</p>

            <h3>CSS skills I picked up include:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Changing font sizes and colors.</li>
                <li>Adding id and class selectors.</li>
                <li>Creating external style sheets.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Lab 05: Layouts</h3>
            <p class="date"><em>October 22, 2025</em></p>
            <p>This lesson revolved around using flexbox and grids in
                CSS. I am finding it very difficult to apply.

            <h3>Skills under development:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Applying media querying</li>
                <li>Using flex</li>
                <li>Using grids</li>
            </ol>
