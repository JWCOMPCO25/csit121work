    <p>Sharks are interesting, yet terrifying creatures. I wouldn't ever want to be near one but I still find them
        cool. A couple months ago, I bought a video game called "Maneater" where you played
        as a shark. The camera and combat was frustrating at times but overall, I found it satisfying to swim around 
        eating everything in sight.
