                <dt>Target Audience</dt>
                <dd>The site is designed for event hosts and attendees, job seekers,
                    and those generally seeking information about the Baltimore Convention
                    Center.

                <dd>There is a lot of repetition to be found here. There is a color theme maintained
                    throughout the entire site. The headers share the same fonts as
                    the main text but uses a blue color to differentiate itself. I especially 
                    like the choice for the link hover color the site uses. It's a beautiful 
                    green that contrast with the links' simple white text.

            <h2>Site Exploration</h2>
            <img src="bcc-site.png" alt="Screen capture of the Baltimore Convention Center website's homepage.">
            <p> Navigating the BCC website was easy. The homepage is laid out in such a way
                that users can quickly find what they're looking for. The site lends itself well
                to its place in the convention industry by making it easy for attendees
                to find necessary directions, parking, transportation, and calendar information within
                less than five clicks.
            </p>
            <p> The choice of blue and white matches the organization's color motif but it
                can at times be difficult on the eyes. I believe this is because of the chosen font size 
                and thickness. The audit score breakdown showed "blind" the most in its "disabilities
                affected" column, which becomes apparent when trying to read the site's text. My
                suggestion would be to choose a thicker font and increase the font size. It's great
                that there is an accessibiity menu in the top-right corner with several options to make
                the pages easier to read, but things should be easier to read by default.
            </p>
            <p> Despite some visual issues, this website is well built. It loads quickly and
                allows users to access necessary information with minimal clicks. While it's easy to find that
                information, seeing it can be difficult due to the text, so I suggested increasing 
                the font size and it's thickness.
